	======HTML&CSS Styled Calculator====== 

	This is Styled Calculator project, that should be developed with provided disign mockups and some CSS values in short time frame. 
 
	I have used HTML for markup and pure CSS for styling, also add JS code for calculator logic(js/calculator.js). Hope it will work well. 
	
 Start application: just open index.html file in browser window or use apache server/node.js for deployment.
	

There are also two theme for picking suitable, with possibility to change on fly (use buttons):  style 1 and style 2. 

For speed building process and workability used pure technologies (HTML, CSS) without preprocessors like (SASS,LESS), that mostly used for more complex projects.

However for production of high amount of themes, quick customization, and buttons features(darker/lighter and soon), better and easeir to use SASS(SCSS). 

I tried to make source files simple and understandable for any level of developers or engineers.  

Let's try to use Calculator! Any suggestions and corrections to project highly appreciate!
